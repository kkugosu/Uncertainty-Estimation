# Uncertainty Estimation

you can see some implementations of uncertainty estimation

Gaussian process 
> [GP](https://github.com/kkugosu/Uncertainty-Estimation/blob/master/Docs/gaussian%20process.md)

The performance of which is best of all but estimation time infinitely incereases as data increase

<br/>

Bayesian Neural Network
> [BNN](https://github.com/kkugosu/Uncertainty-Estimation/blob/master/Docs/bayesian%20neural%20network.md)

<br/>
I implemented naive bnn and convolutional bnn

<br/>
the performance of which is not like gaussian process but reduced estimation time

Mixture Density Network
Doesn't have noise assumption so we need more data but The most practical model so far
