# Uncertainty Estimation

you can see some implementations of uncertainty estimation

Gaussian process

The performance of which is best of all but estimation time infinitely incereases as data increase

<br/>

Bayesian Neural Network
> [BNN](https://github.com/kkugosu/Uncertainty-Estimation/blob/master/Docs/bayesian%20neural%20network.md)

<br/>
I implemented naive bnn and convolutional bnn

<br/>

the performance of which is not like gaussian process but reduced estimation time

<br/>

Mixture Density Network
> [MDN](https://github.com/kkugosu/Uncertainty-Estimation/blob/master/Docs/mixture%20density%20network.md)

<br/>

Doesn't have noise assumption so we need more data but The most practical model so far
